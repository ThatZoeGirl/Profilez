# Profilez
Profilez is a cross-server tool to:
- Make a profile
- Make intros
- See information about people
- some other stuff, idk, i'm bad at making readme's

### profile
A profile can include:

  `Nickname`, `ProfileCreationTime`,
  `Boundries`, `Description`,
  `Rating`, `Personality`

### extra

I'll make a better readme once i have something.
